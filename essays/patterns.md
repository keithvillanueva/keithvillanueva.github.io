*Pattern: a reliable sample of traits, acts, tendencies, or other observable characteristics of a person, group, or institution.*
<br>
In nature, patterns are everywhere. Many times, these patterns play a big part to an organism'ssurvival. One such example of this is the owl, butterfly whose spotted wings imitate the appearance of an owl to deter its predators. These patterns on their wings buy these butterflies at least a bit more time to survive in the wild. One example of a pattern that is not super crucial to an organism's survival is the rings in the logs of trees. Though this pattern may be by coincidence and a result of the tree getting bigger and growing older, this pattern signifies the large amount of time the tree has gone through, reaching up to the hundreds of years and rings. 

## In the context of programming

Similarly, in software engineering, design patterns emerge not by chance, but as a result of developers solving common problems. Design patterns are general solutions to commonly occuring challenges to be solved by software engineers in real life scenarios. Software engineers around the world have most likely faced many of the same general problems, but the specifics and implementations to solve each problem separate the good developerss from the greats. Recognizing the general pattern in the problem allows for more thinking toward solving the specifics of your own problem.

## In the context of my life
Many mathematical classes rely heavily on pattern recognition and following some set of steps to arrive at the right answer. My personaly music taste focuses mainly on the beat of the music and the backing track versus the lyrics of songs. Though math and art are seen as two completely different fields of interest, they share the fact that patterns are very relevant. Similarly in software engineering, two seemingly unrelated problems may have some connection through patterns. In my own code, I found patterns between our weekly assignments and tests. Finding these patterns allowed me to quickly go through most of the general issues of the test and focus most of my time on the specifics.

Ultimately, design patterns are more than just general solutions to common software engineering problems; theyâ€™re blueprints to saving time in problem areas that have been solved countless times before already. They're crucial to build upon as newer problems arise.
