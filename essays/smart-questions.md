## Did Teachers Lie About Stupid Questions?
I've had many professors and teachers in throughout my life start class off by saying there is no such thing as a stupid question. This was one of the most said phrases by my professor last semester. The class he was teaching was known for being a much bigger step up from our previous computer science classes, and he wasn't afraid to tell us that learning the material would be challenging. He would repeatedly say "There are no stupid questions" in order to encourage us to not be shy to inquire further about concepts we couldn't understand. While I do think there are no stupid questions, it is much better to first take a step back to think a little more about what it is that you want to ask, and ask a smart question.

One of the main reasons why people may think there exists stupid questions is because some of these questions can be answered by just putting in the tiniest amount of effort. One prevalent example of this is asking questions that are already written, whether it be on the whiteboard or in the syllabus. Before asking questions, it is important to first try to figure out a solution on your own. By doing so, it can be a more effective way to learn how to solve problems as you come up with your own solution. However, when you just can't seem to understand something, it is time to ask a smart question. 

## Whatâ€™s a Smart Question?
Smart questions often require some type of plan beforehand in order to effectively communicate the problem you are trying to solve and your current thoughts about the issue. It is first important to choose the right place to ask your question. You wouldn't try asking how to cook pasta on a forum about woodworking. Finding the right place to ask your question will give you many like-minded people to ask. After finding a suitable forum, providing a clear description of the issue you are trying to solve is sure to help readers understand what end goal you are looking for. It is important to be precise and descriptive, but be sure to be concise in wording. Too much detail at first can burden or distract readers from the main goal. 

One example I found of a smart question online is [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) on StackOverflow (forum for software developers) which asked "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?". In the post the user went on to clearly explain the issue that they were having trouble wrapping their head around. They explained that in both Java and C++ programming languages for their program, their program was somehow running faster when the array was sorted versus when it was unsorted. In the post the user provided snippets of their code and their current thinking as to what was happening under the hood in the compiler, CPU, and cache. The user effectively communicated their problem and gave concise descriptions about the issue, adding their code to provide context. In the comments, one user was able to answer the problem with many others in agreement in other threads.

However in [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35181785/android-sometimes-force-kills-application) this user did not ask a smart question. Their title "Android sometimes force kills application" is unclear as to what they think could be causing an issue. In their description of the issue, they provided a reenactment of how to produce the issue again, which is good, but they failed to provide the additional context surrounding the issue, as can be seen in many of the comments asking for additional information. Answers to the problem are unclear and there is no consensus on the right solution to their issue.

## Asking Smart Questions for Software Engineering
For software engineers, asking smart questions is crucial to understanding and learning difficult topics. Asking smart questions to those that are more knowledgeable than yourself about a topic will support growth in skills and knowledge in software engineering. When asking smart questions, first try to understand the problem on your own. If that fails then find a suitable place for your question and be clear and concise in providing descriptions and context. Not so smart questions fail to provide a clear end goal that is meant to be accomplished and unclear circumstances. Asking smart questions for software engineers is the start of learning.
