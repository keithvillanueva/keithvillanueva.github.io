Like many people just getting into tech today, my interest first started because of video games. Sandbox games like Minecraft and first-person shooter games like Call of Duty attracted people from all walks of life. I personally, was obsessed with Minecraft. I would spend hours in the game trying to build cool structures out of various blocks, I wreaked havoc on all the animals I would see, and I'd watch videos on YouTube to see what else I could do. 

One thing I couldn't wrap my head around though was redstone. Redstone in Minecraft is sort of like electricity and can be used to power very complex machines. In a way it was also similar to coding as it was possible to make things similar to if/else statements using just redstone.

## So what?
One of the main reasons I first got into programming was to make games. The first game I ever created from scratch was made using Scratch. Scratch is a learning tool made by MIT that utilizes blocks to represent code. By piecing together blocks, similar to building legos, anybody can make a running program. This first game was an obstacle course containing three stages where users had to touch enemies to defeat them. Obviously this game I made in middle school was still very rough around the edges, but it got the wheels turning in my head about going into technology in the future.

## What now?
Though games were what first got me into programming, software engineering is one of the things keeping me interested. Through the class I am currently taking in college (ICS 314) I hope to gain skills in basic website design, databases, programming languages like JavaScript and HTML, and website security. By the end of the semester I hope to be able to build a working website for some other purpose than a professional portfolio. In the meantime, I'll work hard to learn as much as I can.
