## Early Days

Like many people getting into tech today, my first interest in the field began with video games. Sandbox games like *Roblox* and first-person shooters like *Call of Duty* attracted players from all walks of life. My personal early obsession was with *Minecraft*. I would spend hours building elaborate structures out of blocks, terrorizing the in-game animals and villagers, and watching YouTube videos to discover new features I could build in my own world. The elements of both exploration and creation in the game kept me hooked.

One thing I could never quite figure out, though, was redstone. In *Minecraft*, redstone acts like a form of electricity and can be used to build surprisingly complex machines. In many ways, it was like programming. It allowed players to create automatic machines to improve efficiency, and mechanisms similar to if/else logic using just redstone.

## So What?

My fascination with video games eventually led me to programming and wanting to make my own video game. The [first game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/176889426/) I ever created was built in Scratch, a visual programming tool that was developed by MIT. Scratch uses colorful blocks to represent lines of code, making it easy for beginners to create functional programs by snapping them together like LEGO bricks. My first game was an obstacle course with three stages, where players had to touch enemies to defeat them. The character inspiration for the game came from another mobile video game I was playing at the time. The movement was clunky and the design was a little rough around the edges, but for a first game made by a middle schooler, I think it was pretty good. That experience sparked a real interest in technology and made me wonder what more I could build through code.

## What Now?

While video games initially drew me into wanting to learn more about programming, it's software engineering that keeps me excited about technology today. In my current college course (ICS 314), I’m learning foundational skills in website design, databases, programming languages like JavaScript and HTML, and website security. By the end of the semester, I hope to be able to create a fully functional website for a real-world purpose—something more than just this personal portfolio. Until then, I’ll keep working hard and learning as much as I can this semester and in the years to come.
