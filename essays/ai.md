# Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314

## I. Introduction

The use of artificial intelligence has become a norm among students in modern education, transforming how some students learn, engage with new concepts, and solve problems. In the context of software engineering, many AI tools offer immediate feedback in the code editor, quickly generate code examples to prompts, clarify complex concepts, and serve as 24/7 available tutors. In ICS 314, the integration of AI has provided both opportunities and challenges. During this semester course, I used the AI tools ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot the most. These tools played different roles in my software engineering journey, from writing code to debugging and documentation. I used ChatGPT for simplification of concepts that were difficult for me, code and idea generation, and troubleshooting. I used Github Copilot for code completion and suggestion.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs (e.g., E18)  
*Example: For the most of the React and Nextjs Experience WODs I would ask ChatGPT "What is x component doing in this code?"*  
*Reflection:* At the time, the nesting of elements was very confusing to me and it was hard for me to wrap my around some of the concepts of these new objects and how it was translating to HTML. I still don't think I have a great understanding of it, but can get by when reading and trying to understand what a piece of code is doing.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs  
*Example: For in-class Practice WODs my experience was similar to the above with the experience WODs.*  
*Reflection:* I hadn't used AI for any assignments prior to Nextjs and React as the earlier assignments were easy enough for me to grasp, but after that point I may have relied too heavily on AI instead of putting in enough time to understand what was going on and improve on this weakness.

### 3. In-class WODs  
*Example: For in-class WODs I used AI to generate code for a typescript function in typescript WOD 3. I believe I copy and pasted the problem to ChatGPT and used the generated code. I tried to solve it myself, but there were a couple minutes left before time ran out, so I used it to get the answer.*  
*Reflection:* At the time I was scared of losing the points. AI was useful in getting the answer but I didn't use it to learn how to do it as I still don't know how to make that type of function and don't believe I have used that type of function ever since that WOD.

### 4. Essays  
*Example: I haven't used any AI for essay generation prior to its use in this essay. I used the prompt "create an essay based on this, leaving any areas where it asks for personal experiences/examples blank for me to fill out" and copy pasted the page.*  
*Reflection:* AI was useful in saving time having to format everthing and getting a foundation for the introduction and later paragrahs. Of course I filled out my own experiences and revised the generated paragraphs to use my own voice.

### 5. Final Project  
*Example: ChatGPT was relied upon heavily during writing the playwright tests for the project and formatting of some elements such as the sidebar.*  
*Reflection:* For the playwright tests I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot all the errors I was getting as most tests were fine when I clicked throuugh each test in debug mode, but running the tests at full speed would result in most tests failing as the sign in page would fail. I would ask ChatGPT what was wrong with the error codes attached and implement them in my code. The responses were useful half the time, but the other half of the responses did not work.

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial  
*Example: I asked ChatGPT “Explain the Observer pattern with a JavaScript example” when trying to understand design patterns.*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or on Discord  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart-Question  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 9. Coding Example (e.g., “Give an example of using Underscore _.pluck”)  
*Example: I prompted ChatGPT with “Give me a JavaScript example using Underscore.js _.pluck to extract names from an array of objects.”*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 10. Explaining Code  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 11. Writing Code  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 12. Documenting Code  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 13. Quality Assurance  
*Example: I pasted a code snippet into ChatGPT and asked, “Fix the ESLint issues in this Meteor component.”*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed  
*Example:*  
*Reflection:* [Insert your experience here.]

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI tools have significantly affected the way I understand and apply software engineering concepts. They provided a supplemental layer of explanation that often helped me bridge the gap between lecture material and application. For example, when I struggled with asynchronous JavaScript and promises, ChatGPT helped break down the flow in simple terms with visual analogies and code examples. However, reliance on AI occasionally made me too passive, and I had to remind myself to independently practice and struggle through code to fully absorb the learning.

---

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I have applied AI tools in various software-related projects.  
*[Insert specific real-world examples here, such as HACC or internships.]*  
In these settings, AI assisted with code reviews, writing documentation, and rapidly prototyping solutions. The real-time guidance from tools like GitHub Copilot often improved efficiency, especially when dealing with unfamiliar APIs or libraries. However, I also learned the importance of validating AI-generated solutions before integrating them into production-level code.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

A recurring challenge with AI in ICS 314 was distinguishing between helpful guidance and misleading output. At times, AI would produce syntactically correct but semantically incorrect code, especially when dealing with specific Meteor/MongoDB integrations. Another challenge was the temptation to overuse AI and bypass the problem-solving process. That said, there are opportunities to formally integrate AI usage into courses—perhaps through structured prompts or AI literacy workshops—to help students use these tools responsibly and effectively.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced learning offers instant feedback, personalized instruction, and more autonomy in how I approach problems. While lectures and documentation are essential, AI can fill in the gaps, especially when instructors are unavailable. However, traditional methods often foster deeper learning through repetition, collaboration, and hands-on struggle. AI tools complement but should not replace these foundations.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

Looking ahead, AI is likely to play a growing role in software engineering education. As models become more context-aware and integrated into IDEs, they can assist not only with syntax but with debugging, refactoring, and design decisions. However, it's crucial to teach students ethical and effective use of AI. Future courses might incorporate AI literacy, critical evaluation skills, and more emphasis on student-AI collaboration rather than dependency.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

Reflecting on my experience in ICS 314, AI has been a valuable but double-edged tool. It enhanced my learning, clarified difficult concepts, and made coding more efficient. However, it also introduced challenges around over-reliance and accuracy. Thoughtful integration of AI into the curriculum—paired with traditional teaching and human mentorship—can provide a balanced and enriched educational experience. Going forward, I recommend clear guidelines, practice prompts, and collaborative case studies to make AI a responsible partner in software engineering education.
