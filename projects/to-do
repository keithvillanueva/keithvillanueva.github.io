This to-do list was made during my freashman year while I was still in ICS 211. It runs uby interacting with a .txt file on my computer.

The to-do list is implemented using Java and makes use of Array Lists and the Scanner class. There are options to add or remove tasks from the checklist and quit when done. 

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 
Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
