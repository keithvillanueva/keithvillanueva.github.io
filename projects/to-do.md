This to-do list was made during my freashman year while I was still in ICS 211. It runs uby interacting with a .txt file on my computer.

The to-do list is implemented using Java and makes use of Array Lists, the Scanner class, and the JOptionPane class. When running the program there are options to add new tasks or remove tasks from the checklist and quit when done. The program interacts with the user through the JOptionPane classs which has a small popup window that prompts the user for input.

In this project I gained experience with reasearching and utilizing different classes in Java and using the different classes to read and write to a text file on my computer in order to save the task list so it isn't deleted when the user quits. I also gained some experience in understanding how to counter misinputs as user input is not always uniform, so the options really forced me to think from a different perspective.
