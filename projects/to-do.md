This to-do list was made during my freshman year while I was still in the Intro to Computer Science II class (ICS 211). The program can interact with the user to prompt them for options of what they would like to do. The actual to-do list of tasks is stored on a .txt file on my computer.

The to-do list is implemented using Java and makes use of Array Lists, the Scanner class, and the JOptionPane class. When running the program there are options to add new tasks or remove tasks from the checklist and quit when done. The program interacts with the user through the JOptionPane class which shows a small popup window that prompts the user for input on what option they would like to pick.

In this project I gained experience with researching and utilizing different classes in Java and using the different classes to read and write to a text file on my computer. By writing to a text file I was able to save the task list for future use when the program is opened again so the changes made by the user aren't deleted when the user quits the program. I also gained some experience in understanding how to counter misinputs as users' input is not always uniform, so the options forced me to think from a different perspective.
